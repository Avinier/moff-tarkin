If their blood gets up.<br> It's war.<br>  This is vengeance for the Red Wedding,  for the Starks, for seven seasons  of taking shit from House Lannister.<br>  So we're landing down in force,  and we're just gonna kill everybody inside the city.<br>  Unfortunately.<br> For them.<br>  [.]<br>  [SCREAMING.]<br>  NUTTER: For the funeral scene, it's all about  blocking where everybody stands.<br>  I work hard about preparation,  because I don't like to waste people's time.<br>  And I want to spend more time directing actors.<br>  FINLEY: Are you this prepared in all areas of your life?  No.<br>  No, I'm not.<br>  If you saw my apartment this morning,  you'd see that, uh,  that didn't get any preparation at all.<br>  I have to have two cleaning ladies come twice a week.<br>  It's, ah It's so awful.<br> It's such a mess.<br>  I want the journey to be just as positive as the end product.<br>  That's important.<br>  Because what you remember is the journey.<br>    All the pyres and get people in the foreground for us.<br>  We'll basically do the eulogy, the speech,  then all coming up to light the pyres,  they look at each other,  then drop down, light the pyre, cut.<br>  We're going to match the last frame of this  to the first frame of that.<br> Fill the frame  and send it to me and David before you go.<br>  Yeah, good.<br> Good morning, brother.<br>  - How are you? - NUTTER: Good, brother.<br>  - So you're just, you're dead.<br> - I'm dead.<br> I'm dead.<br>  NUTTER: Everyone wants a pied piper.<br>  Not to say that I'm the pied piper,  but I definitely can fake it.<br>  You create your own world behind the camera.<br>  You'll take the pin out,  and you're reaching down here.<br> As you put it into his chest,  you look at his eyes, like, "You're a Stark now," right?  - Yeah.<br> - Then you stand up.<br>  [EXHALES.]<br> Okay.<br>  - And then you go.<br> - TURNER: Okay, cool.<br>  So just give me like a couple minutes to get into it.<br>  - NUTTER: The way we just did it? - ASSISTANT: Could we get  everybody on their marks for the reference.<br>  NUTTER: Let's see here.<br>  Here you go, my brother.<br> You're here.<br>  A bunch of wildlings behind you.<br>  If you guys can all meet him there  NUTTER: I get pretty tired, but I get invigorated too.<br>  I guess sometimes it's a bit of performance anxiety,  where I want to do a good job  so that everyone feels that, "He knows what he's doing.<br>"  This is a dream job for a director.<br>  After directing Seasons 2, 3, and 5,  I had to step away for a couple seasons due to back issues.<br>  And I had a couple surgeries.<br>  So I missed it beyond belief.<br>  And coming back now, I appreciate it so much that  This show saved my life.<br>  [.]<br>  We're now going to talk about why we're here.<br>  Everyone here, you've all lost mothers, brothers,  and friends, and sisters, and wives, and everything.<br>  So background, it's all about playing that attitude  all the way through.<br> Okay, ready? Here we go.<br>  My father died in a car accident  when I was a year-and-a-half old,  so my mother and I grew up together.<br>  She would listen to music, and I'd sing and perform  for her friends that would come over for dinner.<br>  I wanted to be the next Barry Manilow.<br>  In college, I realized that wasn't gonna happen for me,  so I said to myself, "What else can I do?"  And realized that my desire to move people emotionally,  I could do it by being involved in filmmaking.<br>  NUTTER: Action.<br>  Spirit move me Every time I'm near you   Whirling like a cyclone in my mind   Baby, I love you come   Come, come into my arms   Let me know the wonder of all of you   Could it be magic?   Oh, come on, come on come on   Come into my arms   Oh, let me know the wonder Of all of you, all of you   Baby, I want you now, now   Oh, now oh, now and hold on fast   Oh, could this be the magic at last?   Could it be magic now?   NUTTER: Now!  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  McCLAY: Mr.<br> David Nutter.<br>  [CROWD CHEERS.]<br>  McCLAY: The atmosphere today when we done the big group photo,  that hit home.<br>  I said goodbye to the Night's Watch.<br>  I've known them for years.<br>  McCLAY: We all have extras jackets,  and I managed to give Kit Harington one today.<br>  He's now trying to give me money for it,  but I won't take the money,  because I just want to give  Jon Snow his jacket, big time.<br>  So he'll never give me that money.<br>  I don't want that money.<br>  It's going to be very emotional for the actors.<br>  I couldn't imagine what it's like  for them to finally say goodbye.<br>  [BANKS CHUCKLING.]<br>  [EXCLAIMING.]<br>  We're in no rush this morning.<br>  CLARKE: No, I know.<br> You know what?

I wonder.<br>  Adjust.<br>  I'm trying to remember the first time we put this on.<br>  I saw a clip of that the other day,  when you were riding on that horse through Belfast,  and it was absolutely freezing.<br>  And you were in, like, nothing but a slip.<br>  Yeah.<br>  No such thing as thermals back then.<br>  [SIGHS.]<br>  I'm not sure this wig's got much more life left in it.<br>  CLARKE: Neither has the head underneath it, so  Oh, it's the last time.<br>  BANKS: It's the last time.<br>  Oh, that's really weird.<br>  [.]<br>  Gimme the ring   Kissed and told   Gimme something that I missed   Gimme the ring   A hand to hold   Wild and what it seems   Gimme the ring   Kill the king   When love is the law   Gimme the ring   Gimme dream child   And do you hear me call?

Oh So this has been really quite hard.<br>  [LAUGHS.]<br> And, um, I think,  you know, some days we've really struggled to get through it.<br>  I think if it wasn't for you guys and your morale,  that's really what has got us through.<br>  But this is obviously a big end.<br>  I know lots of you are going home  as of the weekend, and I hope  that we get other projects like this again.<br>  BARRIE: I don't.<br>  [ALL LAUGHING.]<br>  Because I want to keep the team together.<br>  So thank you, everybody.<br> Thank you.<br>  [ALL CHEER AND CLAP.]<br>  McCLAY: So it's me, you, Big Johnny.<br>  Shane Cavanaugh's coming in too.<br>  All right.<br>  I heard it's only 12 people doing it.<br>  Yeah, there's only 10 Unsullied.<br>  McCLAY: You all right, man?  There's very few of us in for this.<br>  McCLAY: I was just told I have a feature  there at the very last episode.<br>  So Jon's honor guard, I was like, no way.<br>  - So - FINLEY: Do you think  you'll get seen on camera?  Eh, because it's such a tight scene  with less numbers, possibly, yeah.<br>  Yeah.<br> So, um  It'll be like, yeah, just point to me,  "Dad, there I am.<br> Look again.<br>"  And he'll be like, "Yep.<br> Again.<br>"  [LAUGHS.]<br>  So it would be a brilliant way  to cap off the season.<br>  2016, 2015.<br>  I'm trying to find Andy McClay's first day.<br>  Ah, there he is.<br>  This is the first makeup look.<br>  I was like, you'll never get a part if you look like that.<br>  You'll have to change your expression.<br>  And then we got Andy McClay.<br>  Cold Andy.<br>  It's as if it's Day 1.<br>  You came in and you told me that your house had just burnt down.<br>  Oh, yeah, the fire in the house.<br>  I was like, and you're here for a makeup test?  Had a fire in the house.<br>  You weren't late either.<br>  No, I wasn't late.<br> This is the thing, man.<br>  Escape from the reality.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  - Right.<br> - Look there, now.<br>  Argh.<br>  - And shoot.<br> - Sorted.<br>  SMYTH: Off you pop, off you pop.<br>  Goodbye, Andy.<br>  McCLAY: This is sinking in now, that it's my last day.<br>  Just back to normal life now, after this.<br>  Good morning, how are you?

[LAUGHS.]<br>  In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen,  I sentence you to die.<br>  Grey Worm.<br>  McCLAY: Grey Worm, he's totally gone,  and of course Jon's trying to save lives,  so him and Grey Worm have a standoff there.<br>  I think that the Starks in the background  are in a very precarious situation,  because we hate Lannisters.<br>  We don't care if they die.<br>  But it's our king's command.<br> If the Unsullied are  pointing their spears at him we're not happy with that.<br>  DAVOS: Easy.<br>  MAN: Set.<br> Three, two, one, Action.<br>  MAN: Cut.<br>  ASSISTANT: Okay, cut there.<br>  [EXHALES.]<br>  So with that, that is a Game of Thrones wrap  on our good friend Jacob Anderson,  Liam Cunningham, and Kit Harington.<br>  CROWD: Keet!

[IN AMERICAN ACCENT.]<br> He said, "How did the Troubles start?  Tell me, how did the Troubles start?"
