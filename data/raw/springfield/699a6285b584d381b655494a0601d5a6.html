You.<br>  I'm going to put a prince in your belly.<br>  Our queen has a keen sense of poetic justice.<br>  What would she do for the man  who rids her of her treasonous brothers?  JON SNOW: My name my real name  is Aegon Targaryen.<br>  It's true, Dany.<br>  If it were true  you'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.<br>  ARYA STARK: She doesn't like your queen, does she?  She's defending our family.<br>  I'm her family, too.<br>  ARYA: Don't forget that.<br>  (MUSIC INTENSIFIES)   (LYANNA MORMONT GASPING)  - (YELLS) - (GIANT WIGHT SHRIEKS)  (GRUNTING)  (DAENERYS TARGARYEN SOBBING)  (SOMBER MUSIC CONCLUDES)   [.]<br>   [.]<br>  [CRYING.]<br>  [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  [SANSA SNIFFLES.]<br>  [CRYING.]<br>  JON: We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters.<br>  To our fathers and mothers.<br>  To our friends.<br>  Our fellow men and women  who set aside their differences  to fight together  and die together  so that others might live.<br>  Everyone in this world  owes them a debt that can never be repaid.<br>  It is our duty and our honor  to keep them alive in memory  for those who come after us  and those who come after them  for as long as men draw breath.<br>  They were the shields that guarded the realms of men.<br>  And we shall never see their like again.<br>  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  MAN: To your health.<br>  Have you seen Arya?  You can still smell the burning bodies,  and that's where your head is at.<br>  - I just want to thank her for-- - I'm sure you do.<br>  Look, it's not about that.<br>  Of course it's about that, you twat.<br>  Why shouldn't it be?  The dead are dead.<br> You're not.<br>  Gendry.<br>  [CHATTERING STOPS.]<br>  That's right, isn't it?  Yes, Your Grace.<br>  You're Robert Baratheon's son.<br>  You are aware he took my family's throne  and tried to have me murdered?  I didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.<br>  Yes, he's dead.<br>  His brothers are too.<br>  So who's Lord of Storm's End now?  I don't know, Your Grace.<br>  Does anyone?  I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.<br>  [PEOPLE MURMURING INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  I can't be.<br> I'm a bastard.<br>  No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End,  the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.<br>  Because that is what I have made you.<br>  To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.<br>  [ALL CHATTERING.]<br> To Gendry!

The last time I saw her,  I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.<br>  - I'm sure you had your reasons.<br> - I did.<br>  - I do.<br> - So did you?  Never got the chance.<br>  She did it to herself.<br>  Or her god did it to her.<br>  Lord of Light.<br>  We play his game for him, we fight his war and win,  and then  he fucks off.<br>  No signs, no blessings.<br> Who knows what he wants?  I don't imagine thinking about that subject  will leave you any happier than before.<br>  And what if I'm not trying to be happy?  Then you're in luck.<br>  We may have defeated them,  but we still have us to contend with.<br>  Thank you.<br> I feel much better.<br>  [LAUGHING BOISTEROUSLY.]<br>  MAN: More ale!  This is clever.<br>  Even better than the saddle I designed for you.<br>  It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built  for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.<br>  I liked that one.<br>  You know our history better than anyone.<br>  That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.<br>  I'm not Lord of Winterfell.<br>  You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.<br>  You don't want it.<br>  I don't really want anymore.<br>  I envy you.<br>  You shouldn't envy me.<br>  Mostly I live in the past.<br>  - TORMUND: All of it.<br> - Go on.<br>  - No, not in one go.<br> - Go on.<br> I believe in you.<br>  TORMUND: We have to celebrate our victory.<br>  Vomiting is not celebrating.<br>  - Yes, it is.<br> - [CHUCKLES.]<br>  Ah!

Most people get bloody murdered,  they stay that way.<br>  - [GRUNTS.]<br> - TORMUND: Not this one.<br>  [MEN LAUGHING.]<br>  Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.<br>  Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting.<br>  Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again.<br>  He keeps fighting.<br> He keeps fighting.<br>  He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought.<br>  What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon?  A madman or a king!  [CROWD CHEERING.]<br>  [.]<br>  - TYRION: Drink.<br> - Drink.<br>  Drink.<br>  [LAUGHING.]<br>  [MEN SINGING INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  Wrong!  Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

And after all that,  this fucker comes north and takes her from me.<br>  Just takes her, like that.<br>  I mean it, Clegane.<br>  My heart is broken.<br>  Don't touch me.<br>  WILLA: You can touch me.<br>  I'm not afraid of wildlings.<br>  Maybe you should be.<br>  [TORMUND CHUCKLING.]<br>  Well, Clegane  it's time to drown our sorrows.<br>  I'm not done with my drink.<br>  - [SIGHS.]<br> - MAN 2: You saved the day.<br>  MAN 1: You owe me one.<br>  - Don't forget that.<br> - MAN 2: For the rest of my days.<br>  Are you ready now?  This is my drink.<br>  [GROWLING.]<br> All right!  SANSA: She could have made you happy, for a little while.<br>  There's only one thing that'll make me happy.<br>  And what's that?  That's my fucking business.<br>  Used to be you couldn't look at me.<br>  That was a long time ago.<br>  I've seen much worse than you since then.<br>  HOUND: Yes, I've heard.<br>  Heard you were broken in.<br>  Heard you were broken in rough.<br>  And he got what he deserved.<br>  I gave it to him.<br>  How?

I hate the fucking North.<br>  It grows on you.<br>  I don't want things growing on me.<br>  How about Tormund Giantsbane?  Has he grown on you?  He was very sad when you left.<br>  You sound quite jealous.<br>  I do, don't I?  It's bloody hot in here.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  [.]<br>  Oh, move aside.<br>  What are you doing?  I'm taking your shirt off.<br>  I've never slept with a knight before.<br>  I've never slept with anyone before.<br>  Then you have to drink.<br> Those are the rules.<br>  I told you--  [WIND WHISTLING.]<br>  Are you drunk?  No.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  Only a little.<br>  [SIGHS.]<br>  I didn't know Ser Jorah well  but I know this.<br>  If he could have chosen a way to die,  it would have been protecting you.<br>  He loved me.<br>  And I couldn't love him back.<br>  Not the way he wanted.<br>  Not the way I love you.<br>  Is that all right?  [SIGHS.]<br>  I wish you'd never told me.<br>  If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.<br>  I try to forget.<br>  Tonight I did for a while,  and then I saw them gathered around you.<br>  I saw the way they looked at you.<br>  I know that look.<br>  So many people have looked at me that way, but never here.<br>  Never on this side of the sea.<br>  I told you I don't want it.<br>  It doesn't matter what you want.<br>  You didn't want to be King in the North.<br>  What happens when they demand you press your claim,  and take what is mine?  I'll refuse.<br>  You are my queen.<br> I don't know what else I can say.<br>  You can say nothing.<br>  To anyone, ever.<br>  Never tell them who you really are.<br>  Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,  and tell no one else.<br>  Or it will take on a life of its own  and you won't be able to control it  or what it does to people.<br>  No matter how many times you bend the knee,  no matter what you swear.<br>  I want it to be the way it was between us.<br>  I have to tell Sansa and Arya.<br>  Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.<br>  She won't.<br>  She's not the girl you grew up with.<br>  Not after what she's seen,  not after what they've done to her.<br>  I owe them the truth.<br>  Even if the truth destroys us?  - It won't.<br> - It will.<br>  I've never begged for anything  but I'm begging you.<br>  [SOFTLY.]<br> Don't do this.<br> Please.<br>  You are my queen.<br>  Nothing will change that.<br>  And they are my family.<br>  We can live together.<br>  We can.<br>  I've just told you how.<br>  [.]<br>  [SIGHS.]<br>  Half are gone.<br>  The Northmen as well.<br>  And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing,  courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.<br>  The balance has grown distressingly even.<br>  When the people find out what we have done for them,  that we saved them--  Cersei will make sure they don't believe it.<br>  We will hit her hard.<br>  We will rip her out root and stem.<br>  The objective here is to remove Cersei  without destroying King's Landing.<br>  VARYS: Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day.<br>  Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands  in her queen's name.<br>  The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.<br>  No matter how many lords turn against her,  as long as she sits on the Iron Throne,  she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.<br>  We need the capital.<br>  I watched the people of King's Landing  rebel against their king when they were hungry,  and that was before winter began.<br>  Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.<br>  JON: We'll surround the city.<br>  If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food,  the dragons will destroy them.<br>  If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack,  we'll defeat them in the field.<br>  Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy,  her reign is over.<br>  All right.<br>  SANSA: The men we have left are exhausted.<br>  Many of them are wounded.<br>  They'll fight better if they have time  to rest and recuperate.<br>  How long do you suggest?  SANSA: I can't say for certain,  not without talking to the officers.<br>  I came north to fight alongside you  at great cost to my armies and myself.<br>  Now that the time has come to reciprocate,  you want to postpone.<br>  It's not just our people.<br> It's yours.<br>  You want to throw them into a war  they're not ready to fight?  The longer I leave my enemies alone,  the stronger they become.<br>  [.]<br>  The Northern forces will honor their promises  and their allegiance  to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.<br>  What you command, we will obey.<br>  TYRION: So  if all are in agreement  Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad  with the Northern troops  and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.<br>  A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor,  and sail from there to Dragonstone  with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.<br>  Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,  as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.<br>  We have won the Great War.<br>  Now we will win the Last War.<br>  In all Seven Kingdoms,  men will live without fear and cruelty  under their rightful queen.<br>  We need a word.<br>  You understand we'd all be dead if not for her.<br>  We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.<br>  Arya's the one that killed the Night King.<br>  Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell--  And we will never forget them.<br>  That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who--  I swore myself and the North to her cause.<br>  I respect that.<br>  You respect it?  We needed her.<br>  We needed her army, her dragons.<br>  You did the right thing.<br>  And we're doing the right thing telling you  we don't trust your queen.<br>  - You don't know her yet.<br> - I'll never know her.<br>  She's not one of us.<br>  If you only trust the people you grew up with,  you won't make many allies.<br>  That's all right.<br>  I don't need many allies.<br>  - JON: Arya - We're family.<br>  The four of us.<br>  The last of the Starks.<br>  I've never been a Stark.<br>  SANSA: You are.<br>  You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.<br>  You're my brother.<br>  Not my half-brother or my bastard brother.<br>  My brother.<br>  It's your choice.<br>  I need to tell you something.<br>  But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.<br>  What is it?  You have to swear it, before I tell you.<br>  How can I promise to keep a secret  if I don't even know what it is?  Because we're family.<br>  Swear it.<br>  I swear it.<br>  I swear it.<br>  Tell them.<br>  TYRION: So she's going to stay here with you?  She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so  Say something snide.<br>  I'm happy.<br>  I'm happy that you're happy.<br>  I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.<br>  [LAUGHS.]<br>  Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall-person jokes?  To climbing mountains.<br> [CUPS CLINK.]<br>  To climbing mountains.<br>  - What's she like down there? - What?  That's not your concern.<br>  I haven't been with a woman for years.<br>  - Give me a morsel.<br> - You're a dog.<br>  I am the Imp, and I demand to know.<br>  BRONN: I knew you were fucking her.<br>  A pair of tall, blond toffs.<br>  Must be like looking in the mirror.<br>  TYRION: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.<br>  Where's your drink?  What are you-- What are you doing up North?  What are you doing with that?  Oh, this?  This is for you.<br>  For both of you.<br>  TYRION: You're supposed to be south.<br>  You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts.<br>  - Do you know that? - That's a bit rude.<br>  Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit,  - and what do I have to show? - You're a knight, thanks to me.<br>  Thanks to me.<br> And that title's worth as much  as a blond hair from your brother's ballsack.<br>  Power resides where men believe--  BRONN: Shut your mouth.<br>  - TYRION: I'm just trying-- - I've never hit a dwarf before,  but say another word and I will belt you.<br>  See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all--  You couldn't do it on your best day,  you one-handed fuck.<br>  And your best days are long gone.<br>  [GROANS.]<br> You broke my nose!  - I did not break your nose.<br> - How do you know?  Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size,  and I know what it sounds like.<br> Now listen.<br>  Your sister offered me Riverrun.<br>  Nice big castle, good lands,  plenty of peasants who do what they're told.<br>  - And you trust Cersei-- - I knew your sister was dead  the second I saw those dragons.<br>  Now, your army may be torn to shit,  but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win.<br>  And it just so happens I'm a betting man.<br>  If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.<br>  Mmm, that's good.<br> Of course, the odds change  if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead.<br>  Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one.<br>  - All of a sudden - TYRION: May I speak?  Why not? Only death will shut you up.<br>  We made a deal long ago.<br> Do you remember?  If anyone offered me money  to kill you, you'd pay me double.<br>  What's double Riverrun?  Highgarden.<br>  You could be Lord of the Reach.<br>  - Highgarden? Are you mad? - It's better than being dead.<br>  He's not going to kill us.<br>  He wouldn't be talking to us if--  The way I see it,  I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.<br>  Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.<br>  BRONN: No? Who were your ancestors,  the ones who made your family rich?  Fancy lads in silk?  They were fucking cutthroats.<br>  That's how all the great houses started, isn't it?  With a hard bastard who was good at killing people.<br>  Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord.<br>  Kill a few thousand, they make you king.<br>  And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family  with their cocksucking ways.<br>  Highgarden.<br>  Give me your word.<br>  You have my word.<br>  None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing.<br>  We ride south in the morning.<br>  We could use an officer  with knowledge of the city's defenses.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br> Oh, no.<br>  No, my fighting days are done.<br>  But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me?  I'll come find you when the war is done.<br>  Till then, don't die.<br>  [DOOR CLOSES.]<br>  For fuck's sake.<br>  On your own?  HOUND: Not anymore.<br>  I don't like crowds.<br>  ARYA: Me neither.<br>  HOUND: Why not? They all love you now.<br>  You're the big hero.<br>  Don't like heroes.<br>  It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.<br>  Felt better than dying.<br>  You're heading to King's Landing?  I have some unfinished business.<br>  Me too.<br>  I don't plan on coming back.<br>  Neither do I.<br>  Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?  Probably.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  [.]<br>  [GROWLING SOFTLY.]<br>  My lady.<br>  "My lord" is the standard response.<br>  Why her?  TYRION: You know she loves your brother.<br>  That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.<br>  You seem determined to dislike her.<br>  A good relationship  between the Iron Throne and the North  has been the core of every peaceful,  prosperous reign we've ever known.<br>  Jon will be Warden of the North,  so a good relationship seems likely.<br>  I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.<br>  Well, I suppose that's up to him.<br>  Sansa, look at me.<br>  With Jon in the capital,  you'll be the true power in the North.<br>  I'd feel much better about the future  if I left here today believing  that you and Daenerys were allies.<br>  What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him.<br>  Your queen still has her dragons--  She's your queen too.<br>  You don't have to be her friend.<br>  But why provoke her?  How is that in the best interest of your family,  - or the North, or--? - You're afraid of her.<br>  Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.<br>  I don't want Jon to go down there.<br>  The men in my family don't do well in the capital.<br>  No, but as your brother once told me,  he's not a Stark.<br>  [SIGHS.]<br>  Are you all right?  [.]<br>  Her people love her, you've seen that.<br>  You've seen how they fight for her.<br>  She wants to make the world a better place.<br>  I believe in her.<br>  Tyrion.<br>  What if there's someone else?  Someone better?  You're not gonna ride the dragon south?  Just a horse.<br>  Rhaegal needs to heal.<br>  He doesn't need me weighing him down.<br>  [SCOFFS.]<br> You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  I'm taking the Free Folk home.<br>  We've had enough of the south.<br>  The women down here don't like me.<br>  This is the North, you know.<br>  And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.<br>  It isn't home.<br>  We need room to wander.<br>  I'll take them back through Castle Black  as soon as the winter storms pass.<br>  Back where we belong.<br>  It's where he belongs too.<br>  A direwolf has no place in the south.<br>  Will you take him with you?  He'll be happier up there.<br>  So would you.<br>  I wish I was going with you.<br>  This is farewell, then.<br>  You never know.<br>  You've got the North in you.<br>  The real North.<br>  Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer  and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown.<br>  There's only so many books a person can read, so we--  I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.<br>  If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.<br>  I hope it's a girl.<br>  [.]<br>  [SNIFFLES.]<br>  [BOTH SNIFFLE.]<br>  You're the best friend I ever had.<br>  You too, Sam.<br>  [GHOST WHINES.]<br>  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  TYRION: Think of the past 20 years.<br>  The war, the murder, the misery.<br>  All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone  who didn't love him back.<br>  How many others know?  Including us? Eight.<br>  Well, then it's not a secret anymore.<br>  It's information.<br>  If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon.<br>  Then what happens?  She loses the North.<br>  She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that.<br>  No, it's worse than that.<br>  He has the better claim to the throne.<br>  He doesn't want the throne.<br>  I'm not sure it matters what he wants.<br>  The fact is, people are drawn to him.<br>  Wildlings, Northmen.<br>  He's a war hero.<br>  He loves our queen.<br>  And she loves him.<br>  If we marry them, they could rule together.<br>  She's his aunt.<br>  That never stopped a Targaryen before.<br>  No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.<br>  Is marrying your aunt common in the North?  You know our queen better than I do.<br>  Do you think she wants to share the throne?  She does not like to have her authority questioned.<br>  Something she has in common  with every monarch who ever lived.<br>  I worry about her state of mind.<br>  We are advisors to the queen.<br>  Worrying about her state of mind is our job.<br>  We still have to take King's Landing.<br>  Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.<br>  That would solve our problems.<br>  [.]<br>  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  [SCREECHING.]<br>  [GURGLING.]<br>  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  [GASPS.]<br>  [.]<br>  [MEN GRUNT.]<br>  [GRUNTS.]<br>  [YELLING.]<br>  [GRUNTING.]<br>  [.]<br>  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  [MEN GRUNTING.]<br>  Get to the skiff.<br> Now!  [.]<br>  SOLDIER 1: Spears!  SOLDIER 2: They're coming round again!  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  [GRUNTS.]<br>  SOLDIER 3: Go!  SOLDIER 4: Clear!  SOLDIER 5: Man your stations!  - [GRUNTS.]<br> - MISSANDEI: No!  [GRUNTS.]<br>  - SOLDIER 4: Go! Go! - SOLDIER 5: Clear!  [ALL COUGHING AND GROANING.]<br>  Missandei?  [PANTING.]<br>  Missandei!  Missandei!  [GASPS.]<br>  CERSEI: Our message was well-received, then?  QYBURN: Your people have heard the Usurper is coming.<br>  They are grateful for your protection  within the walls of the Red Keep.<br>  You're certain about the dragon?  I saw it sink beneath the waves.<br>  That must have been glorious.<br>  The glory is yours, my queen.<br>  When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land,  the Kraken shall rule the sea  and our child shall one day rule them all.<br>  [.]<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  [SOFTLY.]<br> She's coming for you.<br>  Of course she is.<br>  Keep the gates open.<br>  If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder  thousands of innocent people first.<br>  So much for "the Breaker of Chains.<br>"  [MISSANDEI PANTING.]<br>  GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen.<br>  We will kill your enemies.<br> All of them.<br>  VARYS: Your Grace.<br>  I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly  if I ever thought you were making a mistake.<br>  This is a mistake.<br>  You saw my child fall from the sky.<br>  They took Missandei.<br>  VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed,  but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied  and the Dothraki,  tens of thousands of innocents will die.<br>  That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep.<br>  These are the people you came here to protect.<br>  I beg you, Your Grace.<br>  Do not destroy the city you came to save.<br>  Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.<br>  Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys?  I'm here to free the world from tyrants.<br>  That is my destiny  and I will serve it, no matter the cost.<br>  It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies  make it to King's Landing.<br>  In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender.<br>  Offer her her life in exchange for the throne.<br>  If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter,  we should make the effort.<br>  Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter.<br>  But perhaps it's good the people see  that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed,  and Cersei Lannister refused.<br>  They should know whom to blame  when the sky falls down upon them.<br>  [.]<br>  I've served tyrants most of my life.<br>  They all talk about destiny.<br>  She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones  and walked out with three dragons.<br>  How could she not believe in destiny?  Perhaps that's the problem.<br>  Her life has convinced her  that she was sent here to save us all.<br>  And how do you know she wasn't?  Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.<br>  Perhaps it's actually a solution.<br>  You know them both.<br>  Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?  He doesn't want the throne.<br>  That's why he bent the knee.<br>  Have you considered the best ruler  might be someone who doesn't want to rule?  We're discussing treason.<br>  Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.<br>  Of course I've thought about it.<br> Thoughts aren't treason.<br>  He's temperate and measured.<br> He's a man,  which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros,  whose support we are going to need.<br>  Joffrey was a man.<br>  I don't think a cock is a true qualification,  as I'm sure you'd agree.<br>  And he's the heir to the throne.<br>  Yes, because he's a man.<br> Cocks are important, I'm afraid.<br>  What about my earlier proposal?  They could rule together as king and queen.<br>  She's too strong for him.<br>  She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.<br>  He could temper her worst impulses.<br>  As you have?  You're drinking quite a lot.<br>  A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.<br>  Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able  to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.<br>  How many kings and queens have you served?  Five? Six? I've lost count.<br>  - You've always known my reasons.<br> - At a certain point,  you choose a person you believe in,  and you fight for that person.<br>  Even if you know it's a mistake?  I believe in our queen.<br>  She'll make the right choice.<br>  With the help of her loyal advisors.<br>  You know where my loyalty stands.<br>  You know I will never betray the realm.<br>  What is the realm?  A vast continent, home to millions of people,  most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.<br>  Millions of people, many of whom will die  if the wrong person sits on that throne.<br>  We don't know their names,  but they're just as real as you and I.<br>  They deserve to live.<br>  They deserve food for their children.<br>  I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.<br>  So, what happens to her?  Please.<br>  Don't.<br>  I've spoken as honestly as I can.<br>  Each of us has a choice to make.<br>  I pray we choose wisely.<br>  [.]<br>  [MAN GRUNTS.]<br>  MAN 1: I'm just about to start it.<br>  WOMAN 1: Good luck.<br>  MAN 2: Protect shell right up to the wall.<br>  MAN 1: All right, I'll put another one on it.<br>  MAN 3: He's headed down to the cellar.<br>  I'll need a cart over here.<br>  MAN 4: That's it, thanks.<br>  Thank you.<br>  WOMAN 2: It's really heavy, mind you.<br>  MAN 5: We need some more water.<br>  MAN 3: Take it down there!  as are the rest of her advisors.<br>  What happened?  Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet.<br>  One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed,  Missandei captured.<br>  I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister.<br>  Seems like I won't get the chance.<br>  [.]<br>  [DOOR CLOSES.]<br>  They're going to destroy that city.<br>  You know they will.<br>  JAIME: Have you ever run away from a fight?  You're not like your sister.<br> You're not.<br>  You're better than she is.<br>  You're a good man and you can't save her.<br>  You don't need to die with her.<br>  Stay here.<br>  Stay with me.<br>  [VOICE BREAKING.]<br> Please.<br>  Stay.<br>  [.]<br>  You think I'm a good man?  I pushed a boy out a tower window,  crippled him for life  for Cersei.<br>  I strangled my cousin with my own hands  just to get back to Cersei.<br>  I would have murdered  every man, woman and child in Riverrun  for Cersei.<br>  [INHALES SHARPLY.]<br>  She's hateful.<br>  And so am I.<br>  [SOBBING.]<br>  [HORSE NEIGHS.]<br>  [BREATHING SHAKILY.]<br>  [SOLDIER SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  [GATE RATTLING.]<br>  My lord.<br>  Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender  and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.<br>  Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender.<br>  If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now.<br>  Qyburn  you're a rational man.<br>  Or so I flatter myself, my lord.<br>  We have a chance here,  perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage.<br>  Yes.<br>  Help me.<br>  I don't want to see this city burn.<br>  I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.<br>  No, it is not a pleasant sound.<br>  I-- I don't want to hear it.<br>  Help me save this city.<br>  My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.<br>  TYRION: Your queen.<br>  Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.<br>  You are her subject.<br>  Her reign is over.<br>  You understand this.<br> Help her understand it.<br>  We understand nothing of the sort.<br>  Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable.<br>  Your armies are battle-weary and depleted,  while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan--  [.]<br>  CAPTAIN: Ready!  Nock!  Draw!  [INHALES DEEPLY.]<br>  [.]<br>  I know you don't care about your people.<br>  Why should you?  They hate you and you hate them.<br>  But you're not a monster.<br>  I know this.<br>  I know this because I've seen it.<br>  You've always loved your children.<br>  More than yourself,  more than Jaime  more than anything.<br>  I beg you.<br>  If not for yourself, then for your child.<br>  Your reign is over,  but that doesn't mean your life has to end.<br>  It doesn't mean your baby has to die.<br>  [EXHALES SHAKILY.]<br>  If you have any last words, now is the time.<br>  [BREATHING HEAVILY.]<br>  [BREATHING SHAKILY.]<br>  Dracarys.<br>  [BREATHING SHAKILY.]<br>  [MOUTHS.]<br> No.<br>  [BREATHING SHAKILY.]<br>  [.]<br><br>
